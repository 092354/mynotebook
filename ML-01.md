# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

## What's machine learning?

### Machine learning algorithms
1. supervised learning - learn from being given "right answers" to predict input, output or X ot Y mapping
   - Regression: predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers.
     > sample, predict price of house
   - Classifiction: predict categories
     > sample: predict tumor classification
2. unsupervised learning - learn something interesting in unlabeld data
   - clustering: takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters
     > sample: google news
   - anomaly detection: find unusual data
   - dimensionality reduction: This lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible.

## Regression Model

### Terminology
1. Training set
   > x = "input" variable/feature
   > 
   > y = "output" variable or "target" vairable
   > 
   > m = number of training examples
   > 
   > (x,y) = single training example
   > 
   > $$(x^{(i)},y^{(i)}) = i^{th}$$ trainning example
