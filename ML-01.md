# Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification

## What's machine learning?

### Machine learning algorithms
1. supervised learning - learn from being given "right answers" to predict input, output or X ot Y mapping
   - Regression: predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers
   - Classifiction: predict categories
   
3. unsupervised learning - learn something interesting in unlabeld data
   - clustering: takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters
5. recommender learning
6. reinforcement learning
