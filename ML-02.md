Linear regression model with multiple input features is Multiple linear regression.

### multiple features

#### Terminology
Training set
   > $x_j = j^{th}$ feature
   > 
   > n = number of features
   > 
   > $x^{(i)}$ = features of $i^{th}$ training example
   > 
   > $x_j^{(i)}$ = value of feature j in  $i^{th}$ training example$

Model
   > $f_{w,b}(x) = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b$
   > 

### Vectorization

#### Vectors
