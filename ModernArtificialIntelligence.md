## Introduction
- why
- what
- who

### AI Recipe:
data + model + compute power

1. data:
  - what: 
    video, text, audio...
  - where: 
    kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), UCI(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), ImageNet(https://image-net.org/)

2. Model
   ANN are couple of equations that mimic the human brain
3. Compute
   compute power to be able to feed data to model to trian model

### Supervised vs Unsupervised AI Training

- Labeled vs unlabeled dataset
  labeled dataset = unlabeled + tag/class associated with it
- supervised learning:
  train with labeled dataset
  performance is assesed by comparing trained model prediction vs. real output

- unsupervised learning:
  train with unlabeld dataset
  target: to find hidden patterns withing the training data
